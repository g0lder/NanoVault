# NanoVault
Just hosting some iPod nano themes for now, sourced mainly from the <a href="https://discord.gg/yFwefCdh76">iPod Nano 6/7 Themes</a> discord.
Please note that some wallpapers do NOT show up in <a href="https://nano.zeehondie.net/n7g_theme_previewer/">Zeehondie's Previewer</a> or therefore the screenshots I took.

<br>
Additionally, check out <a href="https://nanolib.net">NanoLib</a> â€” a growing theme library and upload hub for iPod Nano 6th and 7th generation customizations. Still in early alpha, but already live and kicking!
