These are custom files for editing things. 

<a href="./main.rs">main.rs</a> is for using local files instead of web files in <a href="https://github.com/thgeraads/n7g/blob/main/theme-creation-guide/README.md">Zeehondie's guide.</a>
Simply rename the .ipsw to myTheme.ipsw and put it in the folder with the scripts.

<a href="./iPod.json">iPod.json</a> is my iPod Nano 7g Handbrake Preset, feel free to send me your own for other nuggies!
